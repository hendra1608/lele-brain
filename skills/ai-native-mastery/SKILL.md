# AI-Native Mastery Skill

This skill ensures that the applications we build are ready to be controlled and understood by AI agents (like Antigravity).

## 1. Agentic UI Architecture
- **Semantic Dominance**: Use proper HTML5 tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`) so AI can "read" the interface.
- **Deterministic IDs**: Ensure all buttons and inputs have unique, stable IDs for reliable AI interaction.
- **Meta-Data Layer**: Provide hidden descriptions for complex UI states that help agents understand the context.

## 2. Structured Outputs
- **API for Agents**: Design endpoints or component props that return structured JSON instead of just rendered HTML.
- **Functional Components**: Build components that can be triggered via "Tools" or "Functions" in an LLM call.

## 3. Human-AI Collaboration (HAI)
- **Feedback Loops**: Design UI that shows when an AI is processing a task.
- **Safety Nets**: Ensure critical actions (deletions, payments) always require a final human click.

## 4. Execution Rules
- Always build with the assumption that an AI might be the next person to "use" this interface.
