description: Lele's Mandatory Self-Critique Workflow
---

1. **Verify DNA Compliance**:
   - Check against `lele-dna.md`: Is typing strict? Is there code trash? Is it modular?
2. **Consult Mastery Skills**:
   - if UI-heavy: Run `ui-premium-vault` checklist.
   - if logic-heavy: Run `performance-optimizer` checklist.
3. **Audit Implementation**:
   - Run `git diff` to ensure no accidental changes or secrets were added.
4. **Final Sync**:
   - Ensure `task.md` is fully updated and lessons learned are recorded in `lele-knowledge.md`.
5. **Report to Bos**:
   - Provide the "Helicopter View" and walkthrough in Indonesian.
