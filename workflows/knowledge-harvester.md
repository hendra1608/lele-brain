# Knowledge Harvester Workflow

This workflow is triggered periodically or after major feature implementations to ensure the brain keeps evolving.

## 1. Proactive Scanning
- Scan recently touched files or related modules.
- Identify "High-Quality Patterns": Look for elegant solutions to complex UI or logic problems developed in the codebase.
- Identify "Dangerous Pitfalls": Look for recurring bugs or anti-patterns that caused friction.

## 2. Wisdom Extraction (AI Reasoning)
- Analyze *why* a certain pattern is effective.
- Distill the pattern into a generalized rule or "Lesson Learned".

## 3. Database Injection
- Append the distilled wisdom to `lele-brain/rules/lele-knowledge.md` under the appropriate section.
- Use the format: `- **[Topic Name]**: [Distilled Wisdom and Context].`

## 4. Continuity Check
- Ensure the new knowledge is reflected in Lele's future plans and implementations.
